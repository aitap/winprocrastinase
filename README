How to use:

Place paths to applications you'd want to limit your presence in (games,
browsers) in blacklist.txt (one line per application). Place paths to
the applications you should be working in (word processor? programming
environment? you tell me) into whitelist.txt.

If there's an exception in the blacklist you can distinguish by looking at
the window title (for example, most websites are for fun, but you do work
in Jupyter Notebook), place such substrings into title_exceptions.txt.

Place them all together with controller.exe and place a shortcut to the latter
into Startup. You will be earning points by providing input to applications
in your whitelist and spending them by having applications from your blacklist
active. Once the balance is overdrawn, siren will sound. After another small
timeout the foreground application will be terminated.

There's no interface to look at. Just keep working.

You'll need CMake and ffmpeg to build the application. The latter is used to
decode the alarm sound into form suitable for WAVE resource.
